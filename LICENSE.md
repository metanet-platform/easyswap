## Regulatory Compliance Framework

### Software Development, Not Money Transmission

This is **software infrastructure**, not a money transmission or exchange service:

**Non-Custodial P2P Tool:**
- ✅ Developers **never** take custody of user funds
- ✅ Users trade **directly peer-to-peer** via atomic swaps
- ✅ No intermediary, broker, or custodian role
- ✅ Autonomous smart contract code executes trades deterministically

**No Economic Operator:**
- ✅ Developers cannot access, freeze, or move funds
- ✅ Developers cannot set prices or modify execution (market-driven)
- ✅ Developers cannot reverse transactions or provide refunds
- ✅ All trading rules hardcoded—admin has zero discretion

**Software Royalty Model (Not Transaction Fees):**
- ✅ Activation fees are **software license royalties**
- ✅ Users pay for **tool usage**, not for developer services
- ✅ Similar to: app store fees, SaaS subscriptions, API usage fees
- ✅ Royalties compensate software development, not intermediary services

**User Responsibility:**
- ⚠️ Users are responsible for their own regulatory compliance
- ⚠️ Users are responsible for tax reporting and KYC/AML if applicable
- ⚠️ Developers provide software only—no custody, accounts, or financial services
- ⚠️ Each user must determine if their jurisdiction allows P2P crypto trading
